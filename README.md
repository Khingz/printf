# printf() Implementation in C

This project aims to recreate the `printf()` function in C, which is a widely-used standard library function that is used to output formatted text. The goal of this project is to help you better understand how the `printf()` function works and how to implement it in your own code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/khingz/printf.git
```

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need a C compiler installed on your system. If you do not have a C compiler installed, you can install one using the following commands:

For Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

For macOS:

```
xcode-select --install
```

## Running the Program

To run the program, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c -o [name of executable file]
```

This will compile the program and create an executable file. You can then run the program using the following command:

```
./[name of executable file]
```

## Usage

The `printf()` function is used to output formatted text to the console. It takes a format string as its first argument, followed by any number of additional arguments that correspond to the format specifiers in the format string.
